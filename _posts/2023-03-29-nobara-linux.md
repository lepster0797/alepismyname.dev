Why Nobara
----
I've been a Windows user for all my life and it's no different in my personal gaming rig. That said, It's still going to be my primary gaming OS only due to the fact that some of the games I play ; Valorant , and soon to be released Honkai StarRail aren't gonna be on Linux. But then I came across Nobara Linux , touted as the ultimate linux gaming distro with out of the box support for Nvidia , Lutris , Wine , Steam and so on. This looked promising I thought to myself, so I decided to give it a try.

I'm a novice when it comes to Linux, so bear with me here as I document my installation proccess. You'll definitely see my ignorance when it comes to Linux. But I still wanna give it a try. Apart from gaming I just want to use Linux day-to-day just to get better at it.

Preparing the Installation Media
----

Preparing the installation media is as simple as going to [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/download-nobara/) and downloading the ISO image, and flashing it to a USB drive using [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher).

I chose the GNOME image, since I liked using GNOME more. I wanted a different experience to Windows okay? I feel like KDE is a lot like windows. People are gonna crucify me for saying that.

Installation
---

So after I've prepared my installation media, I plugged it into the front usb port on my case and popped into the BIOS to boot override and directly boot into the installation media.
I was then greeted by Grub asking me to choose one of 3 options there as you can see in the image ; 

Here's where all the fun stuff starts to happen. I chose Start Nobara Linux 37 and it shows me the loading circle , after a bit it just gives me a blank screen.
